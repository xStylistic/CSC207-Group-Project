## About Our Game

We made this for our CSC207 final project to help students like us stay motivated to study. Doing dozens to hundreds of flashcards gets mundane and tiring, so to solve that problem, Flashcard Farm was created. This colourful and vibrant studying tool will be sure to keep you captivated. 

Download Flashcard Farm today to enhance your studying experience :)

## Functionalities and Specifications
* Our application utilizes a fully implemented Swing GUI, where users can upload a .txt flashcard set file, choose a difficulty level, and complete their flashcard set.
* Our game has three different difficulties, 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard'. 'Medium' and 'Hard' difficulties will have a time limit for how long you have to answer the question. 
* An animal joins your farm with every correct answer and leaves your farm with every incorrect answer.
* The goal is to ensure your farm is as full as possible (so you need to be correctly answering every question!)
* The timer feature is there to test your speed and knowledge to ensure you truly know it all.

## Future Work

Things we wanted to add if we had more time:
* Review answers at the end, see your wrong answers and compare
* Gameover screen
* More detailed statistics at the end of the game
* Starting screen
* Past flashcard set storage, so you only need to upload the set once and you'll be able to practice it over and over in different difficulties
* Different ways to answer the question other than just typing like 'True' or 'False' and multiple choice
