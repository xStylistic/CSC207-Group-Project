# 📦 Flashcard Farm

> *Your new fun tool for studying!*


## 🌟 Highlights

- Sick of using boring old Anki flashcards? Flashcard Farm will solve your problem. 
- Animal themed flashcard game to get you those A's!

## ℹ️ Overview

We made this program to help students like us stay motivated to study. Doing so dozens to hundreds of flashcards gets mundane and tiring, so to solve that problem, Flashcard Farm was born. This colourful and vibrant studying tool will be sure to keep you captivated. 

Upload your flashcard set as a .txt file to begin the game. You will have the option of three different difficulties, 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard'. 'Medium' and 'Hard' difficulties will have a time limit for how long you have to answer the question. An animal joins your farm with every correct answer and leaves your farm with every incorrect answer. The timer feature is there to test your speed and knowledge to ensure you truly know it all. 

Download Flashcard Farm today to enhance your studying experience :)
