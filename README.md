Story 1:
Ben has a chemistry exam tomorrow but hasnâ€™t started studying for it. Ben is not motivated to study and wants to spend time playing Fortnite. 
Thankfully for Ben, this flashcard game will keep Ben motivated and entertained to study for his chemistry exam. Good thing this is almost as 
addicting as Fortnite so Ben will not be failing his chemistry exam. After getting a 100 on his exam, he played Fortnite for days!
