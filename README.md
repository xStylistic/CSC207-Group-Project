## About Our Game

We made this for our CSC207 final project to help students like us stay motivated to study. Doing dozens to hundreds of flashcards gets mundane and tiring, so to solve that problem, Flashcard Farm was created. This colourful and vibrant studying tool will be sure to keep you captivated. 

Download Flashcard Farm today to enhance your studying experience :)

## Functionalities and Specifications
* Our application utilizes a fully implemented Swing GUI, where users can upload a .txt flashcard set file, choose a difficulty level, and complete their flashcard set.
* Our game has three different difficulties, 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard'. 'Medium' and 'Hard' difficulties will have a time limit for how long you have to answer the question. 
* An animal joins your farm with every correct answer and leaves your farm with every incorrect answer.
* The goal is to ensure your farm is as full as possible (so you need to be correctly answering every question!)
* The timer feature is there to test your speed and knowledge to ensure you truly know it all.

## Installation

* Download all the files from this repository and launch a Java IDE
* Minimum JDK Requirements: Java SE 11
* After downloading all the files, go to: **src -> main -> java -> app -> MainApplication** and click **run**
* Make sure all problem sets you upload are in .txt format

## Future Work

Things we wanted to add if we had more time:
* Review answers at the end, see your wrong answers and compare
* Gameover screen
* More detailed statistics at the end of the game
* Starting screen
* Past flashcard set storage, so you only need to upload the set once and you'll be able to practice it over and over in different difficulties
* Different ways to answer the question other than just typing like 'True' or 'False' and multiple choice

## Accessibility Report
### Principles
* Equitable Use: The program ensures accessibility for users by utilizing a simple and widely recognized .txt format for study set inputs. This approach removes barriers for users who might not be familiar with advanced formats or tools, making it equally usable for all. This program democratizes studying and gamified learning.
* Flexibility in Use: The gamified elements—adding or removing animals and displaying fun facts—cater to both visual and textual learners, improving engagement for a broader audience. Users can pace themselves, deciding how and when to interact with the program, which adapts to their preferred study habits. This flexibility makes it effective for diverse learning styles and motivations. The User also has the option to ramp up the pressure with a clock. This way, we provide a plethora of options and can adapt to the needs of everyone.
* Simple and Intuitive Use: The program’s interface and flow are designed to be straightforward. Uploading a .txt file and answering questions aligns with familiar actions, ensuring a smooth user experience. 
* Perceptible Information: Users receive immediate feedback through visible changes (animals added or removed) and textual reinforcement (fun facts displayed for correct answers). These feedback mechanisms are accessible to users regardless of their sensory abilities, ensuring information is clear and understandable. This design keeps users informed and motivated throughout the study process.
* Tolerance for Error: The program is designed to encourage learning from mistakes rather than penalizing users harshly. Incorrect answers result in a negative response (losing an animal), while the opportunity to answer again fosters a growth-oriented mindset. 
* Low Physical Effort: Interactions are streamlined to require minimal physical input, such as uploading a file or typing an answer, reducing fatigue for users with physical limitations. The program’s simplicity ensures that it’s accessible for extended study sessions without unnecessary strain. 
* Size and Space for Approach and Use: The program is currently limited to Desktop. Efforts to expand the program to mobile or other devices would require further courses of action in the future. Also, if such an endeavour was taken, it would not use the Swing Module.


### Target Market
Our program is ideally marketed towards younger students, particularly those in elementary and middle school, who are eager to learn about new subjects while also engaging with animals and nature. By combining studying with gamified elements, such as building a virtual farm and learning fun facts about animals, the program appeals to children’s natural curiosity and love for interactive experiences. Parents and educators can use this tool to make studying more enjoyable and effective, helping students retain information while fostering an appreciation for wildlife and the environment. This unique combination of education and entertainment makes it a valuable resource for both academic learning and personal growth.

### Non-target Market
Our program may be less likely to be used by certain demographics due to its reliance on gamified elements and its focus on animals, which might not resonate equally with all users. For example, older students or adults may perceive the animal-themed incentives as too childish, potentially limiting its appeal to younger audiences. Additionally, users without reliable access to computers or the internet, such as those in underserved communities, may face barriers to using the program. Furthermore, the program’s reliance on English for the study sets could exclude non-English-speaking users, creating a language accessibility gap. To address these potential limitations, future iterations could include customizable themes, offline functionality, and multilingual support to make the program more inclusive and accessible across demographics.
