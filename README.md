Story 1:
Ben has a chemistry exam tomorrow but hasn’t started studying for it. Ben is not motivated to study and wants to spend time playing Fortnite. 
Thankfully for Ben, this flashcard game will keep Ben motivated and entertained to study for his chemistry exam. Good thing this is almost as 
addicting as Fortnite so Ben will not be failing his chemistry exam. After getting a 100 on his exam, he played Fortnite for days!

Story 2:
Jerry likes to multitask and dislikes the menial repetitiveness of memorizing. Conveniently, Jerry likes learning about different types and species of animals. Jerry needs a way to study that combines his interest and boring information. He loads up the app and pastes in topic questions. As he answers questions correctly, the app focuses on the new animal species arriving at Jerry’s farm. At the end, the app gives Jerry exciting facts about these animals that he helped to save (e.g. Specific species of the initial variations in the farm as well as their rarity and current population in the world). Using this study tool that integrates a gamification of concepts with knowledge that seems more attractive to Jerry, he gains enjoyment while answering tedious questions.
