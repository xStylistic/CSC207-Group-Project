Ben has a chemistry exam tomorrow but hasn’t started studying for it. Ben is not motivated to study and wants to spend time playing Fortnite. 
Thankfully for Ben, this flashcard game will keep Ben motivated and entertained to study for his chemistry exam. Good thing this is almost as 
addicting as Fortnite so Ben will not be failing his chemistry exam. After getting a 100 on his exam, he played Fortnite for days!

Story 3:
John is not in the mood for serious studying as he is tired and his biology exam is 2 weeks away so he wants to

and see them die less. After using this tool, John feels less stressed from studying and also feels his time was 
productive.
