# TODOs for each story
- Cut down the stories into the more independent format on the slides (IN YOUR DOMAIN)
"As a user, I want to be able to discover, RSVP to, and manage events in
my organization so that I can easily participate in relevant social and
professional gatherings. (Thanks ChatGPT!)" into "As a user, I want to browse a list of upcoming events in my organization so
that I can find ones that interest me."
- Convert each user story into a list of use cases that allow this to happen (Sequence of actions)
- Each use case has a set of interactions with the system 


## Main Story:
As a student user, I want to be able to load a batch of questions and then start reviewing the questions and answers in a more intuitive and motivated way.
Interactions 1: 
* User clicks a choose file button 
* User can find their question set to upload

## Story 1:
As a student user, I want to be able to be given a random review question that I inputted at the beginning of the app session, submit the question and check if I was right or wrong.

### Use Case 1: Give user a question
Interactions 1: 
* User clicks the button "Start" to begin session, "Next Question" to continue through
* A question appears, and a text field under line appears
### User Case 2: Allow user to enter answer in a text field and submit the question
Interactions 2:
* User types out their answer to the generated review question in the text field.
* User clicks "Check answer".
### User Case 3: Check if the user's answer is right or wrong and give an output on the application
Interactions 3:
* User clicks "Check Answer", to check whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
* If users answer was correct, the text will turn green.
* If users answer was incorrect, the correct answer will overwrite their answer in red.
## Story 2:
Ben has a chemistry exam tomorrow but hasnâ€™t started studying for it. Ben is not motivated to study and wants to spend time playing games. 
Thankfully for Ben, this flashcard game will keep Ben motivated and entertained to study for his chemistry exam. The fun facts about these 
animals will keep Ben entertained while studying for his chemistry exam.

So as a student user, I want to be able to keep track of the animals and learn about the animals that I've gathered over the period I've been 
studying for my exam so that it would keep me entertained and encourage me to keep studying. 

### Use Case 1: Gain an animal when correctly answers the question
Interactions 1:
* User answers the question based on the question type (Textfield or Button).
* Use the interactor to check if the question is correct.
* The program randomly creates an instance of the abstract Animal class and adds the animal to the farm.
### Use Case 2: Allow users to view the fun fact about the animal they just obtained
Interaction 2:
* User clicks the 'View Fact' Button on the right side of the GUI
* JLabel appears which shows the fact-specific to the animal through the use of API
### Use Case 3: Removes an animal when incorrectly answers the question
Interactions 3:
* User answers the question based on the question type (Textfield or Button)
* Use the interactor to check if the question is incorrect.
* The program randomly chooses an instance of the abstract Animal class in the farm and removes it.
  

## Story 3:
As a student studying throughout the term, I want different levels of intensities of revising content depending on how 
urgent and important the learning is. This will allow me to stay engaged in my revision and have a more relaxed time, 
or a more vigorous session, as required.

### Use Case 1: Selecting Revision Intensity Level
Interactions:
* User opens the app and is presented with mode options (Easy, Medium, Hard) 
* User selects the mode they want by clicking on the corresponding button, depending on the intensity of revision 
  required. 

### Use Case 2: Adjusting Parameters Based on Selected Mode
Interactions:
* User clicks 'Easy', 'Medium', or 'Hard' to begin a session which opens the questions interface with the parameters adjusted based 
  on the mode (i.e. How much time is given to answer each question, the severity of the punishment/rewards for answers 
  and the quantity of questions)

  * If 'Easy' is chosen, in the session while answering each question (Story 1), there is no timer, and the amount of animals loss is low.
  * If 'Medium' is chosen, in the session, there is a timer for each question (Story 4). Failing to answer the question in time will cause you
    to lose an animal and proceed to the next question. 
  * If 'Hard' is chosen, in the session, there is a timer for each question (Story 4). Failing to answer the question will kill all animals on the
    farm and you will have to restart. 

* The user then interacts with the use cases from story 1 or story 4 based on the selections

## Story 4:
Jeremy struggles under time pressure, leading to suboptimal results in his exams. Hence, as a student user, the ability to have a simulated 
clock or some tool to keep him accountable on his time is critical. 

### Use Case 1: Timed Questions Answering Medium Mode
Interactions 1:
* While the user is answering questions (Story #1), he has a timer that paces him.
* There is a ticking clock on every single question.
* Failing to answer the question in time will cause an animal to be lost from the farm
* There is also a clock tracking his total time spent.
### Use Case 2: Timed Questions Answering Hard Mode
Interactions 2:
* Same as Use Case 1 but if the user fails to answer a question within the time frame or gets one wrong, you will lose all animals
  and the game will end.
* They will have the option to try again or choose a different difficulty level.

## Story 5:
Polly is trying to get 100 on her psychology exam. She needs to know every term and concept very well. In order for her to achieve 100 on the exam, she needs to be able to answer all the flashcards word for word under a certain time limit to simulate a testing environment. So as a student user, she needs to be able to check if she truly understands the material fully. 

### Use Case 1: Answer Evaluation and Feedback (Story 1)
Interactions 1:
* System evaluates the user's submitted answer.
* System displays feedback below the submission button, indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
* If incorrect, the system provides the correct answer for the user to review.
### Use Case 2: Timed Response to Questions (Story 4)
Interactions 2:
* User initiates the question session by clicking a "Start Timer" button.
* A countdown timer will be visible on the screen.
* User enters their answer within the time limit and clicks "Submit".
* Program provides immediate feedback and resets the timer for the next question.
### Use Case 3: End-of-Game Feedback
Interactions 3:
* User completes the final question and clicks "Finish".
* A performance summary that includes the percentage of correct answers and the total time spent per question will be displayed at the end
  for easy and medium mode.
* Hard mode will only display total time spent and amount of time taken per question. 
* The program will provide options for the user to repeat the study set or to upload a new one.
### Use Case 4: End-of-Game Review
Interactions 4:
* User can compare their answers and the correct answers.
